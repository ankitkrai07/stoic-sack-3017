          How does TaxTim work?
        </Heading>
        <Text fontSize="lg">
          After registering on the TaxTim website, TaxTim will appear on screen
          and start asking you questions about your salary, expenses and other
          incomes. Much like a WhatsApp chat, the conversation is interactive
          and will explain all those complicated tax terms in simple to
          understand plain language that absolutely everyone can follow. After
          the chat TaxTim fills in your tax return forms instantly and submits
          them to SARS in just a click!

          SARS has created one of the best systems in the world for submitting
          tax returns online. Think of TaxTim as a layer on top of SARS eFiling,

          Aren't my taxes too complicated for TaxTim to handle?

        <Text fontSize="lg">
          No individual taxpayer or tax situation is too complicated for us to
          handle. The only section we do not complete for people is the Farming
          section, which we hope doesn't affect too many of you. So from foreign
          dividends to local business, from independent contractors to capital
          gains - you name it - TaxTim is perfectly suited to take care of any
          tax situation and complete and submit your tax return to SARS, whether
          it's simple or complicated.

          Is it easy to switch from eFiling to TaxTim?
        </Heading>
        <Text fontSize="lg">
          Yes it is. Connecting TaxTim to your eFiling profile takes less than a
          minute (on average) and once connected you can import your saved IRP5s
          from eFiling (saves you time), submit your completed tax returns to
          eFiling in a click, get your ITA34 assessments and letters (we'll
          explain what these mean when we send them to you) and upload
          supporting documents. All your TaxTim submissions are copied onto
          eFiling automatically so you can go back to eFiling should you ever
          wish to.

          How much does it cost?
        </Heading>
        <Text fontSize="lg">
          For our latest pricing, please see our pricing page. Please note the
          price quoted is per tax return and is a once-off price, NOT a
          subscription or monthly cost. Therefore, in most cases where you only
          need to file a tax return once in a year, then the cost will be one
          single payment. If you are behind in your tax return filings and you
          need the prior year and current year filed, you will need to pay the
          fee twice (two tax returns).
          <br />
          We have partnerships with some of South Africa's biggest brands, so
          look out for discounts that may apply to you - some offer TaxTim for
          free! First time users currently qualify for 15% off TaxTim if they
          pay upfront.

          Do I need to have all my documents prepared before I start with

        </Heading>
        <Text fontSize="lg">
          No you don't. TaxTim will ask you for specific information from your
          documents as you follow the on screen process. TaxTim will tell you
          what documents you need and where to look on them for the numbers you
          need. If you don't have the document required TaxTim will help you to
          get it from your medical scheme, investment house, etc. You can start
          and stop, leave and come back at any time - your work is saved
          automatically as you go.

          Is my tax return checked before it goes to SARS?
        </Heading>
        <Text fontSize="lg">
          Yes, our system checks your tax return before it is submitted to SARS.
          Remember, you are responsible for filling in the correct amounts (only
          you know these!) but we check to ensure it makes sense and there are
          no obvious duplicates or omissions and you have answered all the
          relevant questions. We will query any unusual amounts with you to
          ensure they are correct. Let us pick up any errors, before your tax
          return gets sent to SARS.

        <Text fontSize="lg">
          Yes, we certainly do! We guide you through the document submission
          process by clarifying which supporting documents you need to submit
          and then sending those documents to SARS for you (only if we have
          connected to your SARS eFiling profile). Depending on load, we also
          help with the dispute resolution / objection process if requested
          (although there will be a fee charged).

        </Heading>
        <Text fontSize="lg">
          You really don't need to worry :) Our team of tax experts will catch
          most mistakes where possible, although we can't tell if you made a
          small mistake like a typo. Our system is designed to be extremely
          thorough, so we will likely ask you more questions than required at
          times, but at least you know you have entered everything and done
          things properly. If you are worried about how to claim or if you can
          claim, you can reach us on live chat or our helpdesk to ask. If you
          notice a problem after you have submitted to SARS, it's easy to make a
          correction on TaxTim and submit a corrected tax return. SARS will not
          get upset with you for making honest mistakes and corrections are
          quite routine.
